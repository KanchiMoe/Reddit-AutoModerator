# r/Videos used to have this horrible bot with thousands of banned channels 
# for no reason, and bad auditing, and no way for other moderators to unban
# channels. 
#
# This condition was used to alert moderators if a now-unbanned channel
# posted but was removed by roger_bot.
#
# There are better ways of doing this. This condition was used originally 
# in 2016 and 2017.

    Your link, (`{{match}}`) is not considered a valid source to use when giving credit for fan art.

    Please use tools such as:

    * [SauceNao](http://saucenao.com/) (recommended)
    * [iqdb](http://www.iqdb.org/)
    * [Google Images](http://images.google.com/)
    * [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/)
    * [Trace.moe](https://trace.moe/)

    And replace your link with one from the artist's Pixiv, Twitter, DeviantArt, etc page.

    Only use {{match}} as a last resort if you can't find it elsewhere, but show/explain that you have tried searching!

    **Posts are subject to removal if no valid source is provided.**

    Hi /u/{{author}}, your {{kind}} to /r/{{subreddit}} has been removed because:

    > Possibly related to the US 2024 election, and not directly related to the Ukraine conflict.

    As the US election draws near, we have seen a rise in posts that are not directly related to the Ukraine conflict.
    
    These posts are better suited elsewhere, such as /r/news, /r/politics or /r/uspolitics.

    *****

    **However**, if your post _is_ related to the Ukraine conflict, use the link below to let the moderators know.

    「[**My post is related to the conflict**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/{{subreddit}}&subject={{kind}}%20is%20related%20to%20conflict&message=\(add%20any%20addational%20comments%20you%20may%20think%20will%20be%20useful%20here.\)%0A%0A-----%0A%0AMods:%20{{kind}}%20caught%20by%202024%20US%20election%20filter.%0A%0ALink:%20{{permalink}}) | [I need assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/{{subreddit}}&subject=Assistance requested for {{kind}} caught by US 2024 election filter&message=\(add any addational comments you may think will be useful here.\)%0A%0A-----%0A%0AMods: Assistance requested for {{kind}} caught by 2024 US election filter.%0A%0ALink: {{permalink}})」

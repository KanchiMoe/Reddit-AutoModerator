# Reddit AutoModerator rules

This is a repo containing rules for Reddit's AutoModerator that I have set up and use on subreddits I moderate. Grouped between general rules, rules specificly targeting spam, and rules used on specific subreddits.

You are free to use and modify any of the rules in this repo for your own subreddits.

# Need help?

If you need help with any of the rules in this repo, [raise an issue](https://github.com/KanchiMoe/Reddit-AutoModerator-rules/issues/new/choose) or send a modmail to any of the subreddits in the `subreddit_specific/` folder.

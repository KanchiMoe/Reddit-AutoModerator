    Hi /u/{{author}},

    Thank you for your {{kind}} to r/{{subreddit}}. You can find it [here]({{permalink}}).

    Unfortunately it has been removed because it contains a link to a crowdfunding website (`{{match}}`).

    Crowdfunding websites are not allowed on r/{{subreddit}} because they are off-topic, and are generally not verifiable.

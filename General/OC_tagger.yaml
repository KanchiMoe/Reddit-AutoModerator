message: |
    Hi /u/{{author}}. We noticed you included "`{{match}}`" in the title of [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}).

    Because of this, it has automatically been marked as 'OC' (original content) - as you drew, made, or created it.

    However, if this was done incorrectly, please let the r/{{subreddit}} moderators know **[by clicking or tapping here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/{{subreddit}}&subject=OC%20tag%20set%20incorrectly&message=[(optional\)%20enter%20more%20information%20here]%0A%0A---%0A%0A{{permalink}})**.

    *****

    _Otherwise, no action is needed on your part. Your post has not been removed._
